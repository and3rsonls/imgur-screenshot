_Making a selection:_<br>

Dependencies
----

(Most are probably pre-installed)<br>
**Tip:** Use [--check](#Installation) to see what's missing.

* curl
* grep
* **Linux only:**
* libnotify-bin
* scrot
* xclip <i>(needed for `copy_url`)</i>
* **OS X only:**
* [terminal-notifier](https://github.com/julienXX/terminal-notifier) *or* [growlnotify](http://growl.info/downloads#generaldownloads)


OS support
----

This will not work on Windows. (maybe with cygwin?)<br>
I have successfully tested this on Ubuntu and OS X.<br>
If this won't work on your OS, [create a new issue](https://github.com/jomo/imgur-screenshot/issues/new?title=add+support+for+_______&body=required+steps+to+make+it+work+on+______:).


Note
----

The screenshot will be taken **after** the selection has been made. This might be annoying if you want to capture something quickly and _then_ want to select an area.
However, you can take a full shot and use the edit option to crop the image before upload.
